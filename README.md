# Debugger

# Basic C++ Error-Checking Tool

This is a simple error-checking tool for C++ code. It detects common syntax errors in C++ code and provides information on how to fix them.

## Features

- Detects missing semicolons.
- Provides error messages indicating the position of the error within the code.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile and run the program.
3. Input the C++ code you want to check.
4. The program will display any detected errors and their positions in the code.

## Example

Suppose we have the following C++ code saved in a file named `Debugger.cpp`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl
    return 0;
}
```
